# Dev Container Configuration Summary

I have successfully created a complete dev container configuration for the ThingsBoard UI Vue3 project. The configuration includes:

## Files Created

1. **`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`** - Main configuration file that defines:
   - Docker Compose setup with two services (app and nginx)
   - VS Code extensions for Vue development
   - Port forwarding for development and preview
   - Post-create command to install dependencies

2. **`.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`** - Docker Compose configuration with:
   - App service based on Node.js 20
   - Nginx service for production preview
   - Volume mappings for development
   - Port mappings for access

3. **`.devcontainer/Dockerfile`** - Custom Docker image with:
   - Base image from official VS Code dev containers
   - Installation of pnpm and yarn
   - Proper user permissions

4. **`.devcontainer/README.md`** - Documentation on how to use the dev container

5. **`.devcontainer/test-devcontainer.sh`** - Test script to verify setup

## Features

- **Development Environment**: Node.js 20 with yarn and pnpm
- **VS Code Extensions**: Pre-configured extensions for Vue, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Stylelint
- **Port Forwarding**: 
  - 3100: Development server
  - 8080: Alternative development server
  - 80: Nginx server for production preview
- **Volume Mapping**: Project files are mapped for live editing
- **Dependency Installation**: Automatically installs project dependencies on container creation

## Usage

To use the dev container:

1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Install the "Dev Containers" extension if not already installed
3. Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted, or use the Command Palette to run "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
4. Wait for the container to build and initialize
5. Start developing with all tools pre-configured

The dev container provides a consistent, isolated development environment that matches the project requirements.
